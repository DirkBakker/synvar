16. cltypx: presence versus absence of x (= any non-subject constituent other than coordinative conjunction) in the cltyp label (col. 13); only available for the finite tenses. Levels: x0 = clause label has no x; x1 = clause label has x; - = non-finite clause type.
17. cltypX: presence versus absence of X (= explicit subject) in the cltyp label (col. 13); only available for the finite tenses. Levels: X0 = label has no X; X1 = label has X before predicate; X2 = label has X after predicate; - = non-finite clause type.

Conjunctive elements:
18. cjelpres: presence versus absence of a conjunctive element (cjel). Levels: asynd = clause has no cjel (i.e., asyndetic); synd = clause has cjel (syndetic).
19. copres: presence versus absence of a "coordinative" cjel; i.e., W or >W. Levels: co+ = has coordinative conjunctive element; co- = has no coordinative conjunctive element.
20. supres: presence versus absence of a "subordinative" cjel. Levels: su- = has no subordinative cjel; su+ = has subordinative cjel.
21. capres: presence versus absence of a conjunctive adverb. Levels: ca- = has no conjunctive adverb; ca+ = has conjunctive adverb.
22. colex: lexeme of coordinative cjel. Levels: W; >w.
23. supdp: phrase dependent part(s) of speech of (the words constituting) the subordinative cjel. See QDFII 2.28.
