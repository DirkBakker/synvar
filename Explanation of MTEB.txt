More information on many of the features can be found in Constantijn Sikkel, Description of Quest II Data File Format (2014) (Henceforth QDFII).

Administrative:
1.  group: main corpus group. Levels: AI = Ancient Inscriptions; MT = Masoretic Text; QH = Qumran Hebrew; RH = Rabbinic Hebrew.

4.  corpus: separate Bible books for MT; separate texts for AI, QH and RH.
5.  verse: book/text, chapter and verse number.

15. cltypW: presence versus absence of W in the cltyp label (col. 13); only available for the finite tenses. Levels: W0 = clause type label has no W; W1 = clause type label has W; - = non-finite clause type.
16. cltypx: presence versus absence of x (= any non-subject constituent other than coordinative conjunction) in the cltyp label (col. 13); only available for the finite tenses. Levels: x0 = clause label has no x; x1 = clause label has x; - = non-finite clause type.
17. cltypX: presence versus absence of X (= explicit subject) in the cltyp label (col. 13); only available for the finite tenses. Levels: X0 = label has no X; X1 = label has X before predicate; X2 = label has X after predicate; - = non-finite clause type.

Conjunctive elements:
18. cjelpres: presence versus absence of a conjunctive element (cjel). Levels: asynd = clause has no cjel (i.e., asyndetic); synd = clause has cjel (syndetic).
19. copres: presence versus absence of a "coordinative" cjel; i.e., W or >W. Levels: co+ = has coordinative conjunctive element; co- = has no coordinative conjunctive element.
20. supres: presence versus absence of a "subordinative" cjel. Levels: su- = has no subordinative cjel; su+ = has subordinative cjel.
21. capres: presence versus absence of a conjunctive adverb. Levels: ca- = has no conjunctive adverb; ca+ = has conjunctive adverb.
22. colex: lexeme of coordinative cjel. Levels: W; >w.
23. supdp: phrase dependent part(s) of speech of (the words constituting) the subordinative cjel. See QDFII 2.28.
24. sulex: lexeme(s) of (the words constituting) the subordinative cjel.
25. calex: lexeme(s) of the conjunctive adverb.

Predicates:
26. predpres: presence versus absence of an overt [core] predicator. Levels: hasP = has predicator; no_P = has no predicator.
27. predstruc: predicate structure; i.e., whether the predicate is simple (consisting of one predicator) or compound (consisting of copula HJH + predicate complement). Levels: simple; compound; noP = has no [core] predicator.
28. predcat: predicate category. Levels: finit = finite; nonfi = non-finite; nonvb = non-verbal.
29. predtyp: predicate type. Levels are prefixed by fi_ = finite; nf_ = non-finite; nv_ = non-verbal. Levels: perf (perfect), impf (imperfect), wayq (wayyiqtol), impv (imperative), infc (infinitive construct), infa (infinitive absolute), ptca (active participle), ptcp (passive participle), adjv (adjectival predicates), nvna (non-verbal predicates other than adjv), nopr (no overt predicator)
30. copulaPC: (for compound predicates; see col. 27 predstruc) the predicate type (see col. 29) of the copula and the precphrcatPP (see col. 31 below) of the predicate complement. CAUTION: In simple predicates, the labels still consist of two items, but those refer to the same (single) predicator.
31. precphrcatPP: phrase category of the predicate complement (if present). Levels: verb = verbal (i.e., participial); nmaj = nominal or adjectival; pron = pronominal; advb = adverbial; prep = prepositional; noPC = clause has no predicate complement.

33. subjpres: presence versus absence of explicit subject (any kind; phrasal or clausal). Levels: hasS = has subject; no_S = no subject.
34. subjcat: subject category; i.e., whether the subject is phrasal or clausal (i.e., a subject clause). Levels: phrasal, clausal; no_subj = no subject.
35. subjphr: phrase type and (where applicable) determination of the phrasal subject. See QDFII 2.46.
